# Push

This skill is scoped to `/Users/bytedance/symphony-go`.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI is installed and available in `PATH`.
- `gh auth status` succeeds for GitHub operations in this repo.

## Goals

- Push current branch changes to `origin` safely.
- Create a PR if none exists for the branch, otherwise update the existing PR.
- Keep branch history clean when remote has moved.
- Create or update GitHub PR titles, PR bodies, and GitHub comments in Chinese.

## Related Skills

- `pull`: use this when push is rejected or sync is not clean (non-fast-forward,
  merge conflict risk, or stale branch).

## Steps

1. Identify current branch and confirm remote state.
2. Run local validation before pushing:
   - `git diff --check`
   - `make build`
3. Push branch to `origin` with upstream tracking if needed, using whatever
   remote URL is already configured.
4. If push is not clean/rejected:
   - If the failure is a non-fast-forward or sync problem, run the `pull`
     skill to merge `origin/main`, resolve conflicts, and rerun validation.
   - Push again; use `--force-with-lease` only when history was rewritten.
   - If the failure is due to auth, permissions, or workflow restrictions on
     the configured remote, stop and surface the exact error instead of
     rewriting remotes or switching protocols as a workaround.

5. Ensure a PR exists for the branch:
   - If no PR exists, create one.
   - If a PR exists and is open, update it.
   - If branch is tied to a closed/merged PR, create a new branch + PR.
   - Write a Chinese PR title that clearly describes the change outcome.
   - For branch updates, explicitly reconsider whether current PR title still
     matches the latest scope; update it if it no longer does.
6. Write/update the PR body in Chinese:
   - If `.github/pull_request_template.md` exists, fill every section with
     concrete content and replace all placeholder comments (`<!-- ... -->`).
   - If no template exists, use the fallback sections `## 摘要`,
     `## 验证`, and `Linear`.
   - If PR already exists, refresh body content so it reflects the total PR
     scope (all intended work on the branch), not just the newest commits,
     including newly added work, removed work, or changed approach.
   - Do not reuse stale description text from earlier iterations.
7. Ensure the PR has the `symphony` label. If the repository lacks that label,
   create it once with a clear description.
8. Reply with the PR URL from `gh pr view`.

## Commands

```sh
# Identify branch
branch=$(git branch --show-current)

# Minimal validation gate for this Go repo
git diff --check
make build

# Initial push: respect the current origin remote.
git push -u origin HEAD

# If that failed because the remote moved, use the pull skill. After
# pull-skill resolution and re-validation, retry the normal push:
git push -u origin HEAD

# If the configured remote rejects the push for auth, permissions, or workflow
# restrictions, stop and surface the exact error.

# Only if history was rewritten locally:
git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD

# Ensure a PR exists (create only if missing)
pr_state=$(gh pr view --json state -q .state 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ "$pr_state" = "MERGED" ] || [ "$pr_state" = "CLOSED" ]; then
  echo "Current branch is tied to a closed PR; create a new branch + PR." >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Write a clear Chinese title that summarizes the shipped change.
pr_title="<中文 PR 标题>"
if [ -z "$pr_state" ]; then
  gh pr create --title "$pr_title"
else
  # Reconsider title on every branch update; edit if scope shifted.
  gh pr edit --title "$pr_title"
fi

# Write/edit PR body in Chinese before validation.
# Example workflow:
# 1) use .github/pull_request_template.md if present; otherwise use
#    sections: 摘要, 验证, Linear
# 2) gh pr edit --body-file /tmp/pr_body.md
# 3) for branch updates, re-check that title/body still match current diff

# Ensure required repo metadata exists.
gh label list --limit 100 | awk '{print $1}' | grep -qx symphony \
  || gh label create symphony --color 5319E7 --description "Symphony workflow"
gh pr edit --add-label symphony

# Show PR URL for the reply
gh pr view --json url -q .url
```

## Notes

- Do not use `--force`; only use `--force-with-lease` as the last resort.
- Distinguish sync problems from remote auth/permission problems:
  - Use the `pull` skill for non-fast-forward or stale-branch issues.
  - Surface auth, permissions, or workflow restrictions directly instead of
    changing remotes or protocols.
