---

Itervox is a long-running Go daemon that polls Linear or GitHub Issues, spawns Claude Code or Codex agents per issue, and gives you a live web dashboard and Bubbletea TUI while they work. One `WORKFLOW.md` per project, one static binary, no runtime. It's a full Go implementation of the [OpenAI Symphony spec](https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/SPEC.md) — formerly known as "Symphony Go".

## Install

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
brew tap vnovick/tap && brew install itervox

# Or: go install
go install github.com/vnovick/itervox/cmd/itervox@latest
```

Pre-built binaries for macOS and Linux are available on the [latest release](https://github.com/vnovick/itervox/releases/latest).

### Authenticating the agent CLI

Itervox shells out to `claude` or `codex` and does **not** manage agent credentials itself. Before running Itervox, authenticate the agent CLI once on every machine where it will execute (including any SSH worker hosts):

```bash
claude login    # for Claude Code
codex login     # for Codex
```

For headless / CI environments, follow the upstream [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) docs — the auth flow is owned by those tools, not Itervox. The same applies to Claude Code on Bedrock or Vertex: set the env vars the upstream CLI expects and Itervox will pass them through to the subprocess.

---

## Why Itervox

You already have the agents. Now orchestrate them. Coding agents are powerful — but running them manually, one issue at a time, doesn't scale. Itervox turns them into a fleet.

| Manual Claude Code / Codex | With Itervox |
|---|---|
| Open terminal, pick an issue | Issues appear in your tracker |
| Create branch, `cd` into repo | Agents spawn in parallel per issue |
| Run `claude` with a prompt | Each agent gets an isolated worktree |
| Wait for the agent, review, open PR | PRs submitted, issues transitioned |
| Repeat, one at a time | You review and merge — that's it |

Pluggable agent backends — Claude Code and Codex are supported today; new backends require a small Go integration. OpenCode and Gemini CLI are on the roadmap.

---

## Built for autonomous agents at scale

- **Concurrent agents** — run up to N agents in parallel with per-state concurrency limits. Scale from 1 to 50+ without config changes.
- **Retry queue** — failed agents auto-retry with exponential backoff (10s, 20s, 40s… capped at 5 min).
- **Pause & resume** — free up a slot; resume later via `--resume` and continue the same session from exactly where it stopped.
- **Input required** — agents can request human input. The question is posted as a tracker comment; reply from Linear/GitHub or the dashboard to resume.
- **Auto-clear workspaces** — delete cloned workspaces after successful completion. Disk stays clean, logs are preserved.
- **Project filters** — filter issues by Linear project when working across multiple repos.
- **Stall detection** — no output inside the stall window? Worker is killed and retried automatically.
- **Auto-pause on open PR** — an existing open PR is detected and the agent pauses to prevent duplicate work.
- **Per-issue profile overrides** — route different issue types through different profiles, models, and machines.
- **API auth** — protect the local HTTP server with a shared token.

## Agent profiles

Define named agent profiles with their own command, backend, and Liquid-templated role prompt. Reference issue data like `{{ issue.identifier }}` and `{{ issue.title }}` directly in the role description. Different issue types get different profiles — a senior reviewer for security work, a fast haiku model for typo fixes, a Codex long-horizon runner for research.

**Rate-limit reassignment use case:** when a provider rate-limits one profile mid-run, Itervox retries the issue on a different profile — your fleet keeps moving instead of grinding to a halt.

---

## Human in the Loop

Autonomous, not unsupervised. Agents do the work. You stay in control at every checkpoint.

- **AI Code Review.** Configure a `reviewer_prompt` and trigger a second agent to review the PR on the correct branch. The reviewer uses the same runner and profile as the original worker.
- **Agent asks for help.** When an agent needs input it pauses and posts a comment directly on the Linear or GitHub issue. Reply from the dashboard or from your tracker — the agent picks up your response and resumes automatically.
- **You merge the PR.** Agents submit PRs and post a session summary as a comment — they never merge. PR links are auto-commented on the tracker issue.

---

## Integrations

| Tracker | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Linear** | GraphQL API, automatic state transitions, project filtering, branch name hints |
| **GitHub Issues** | Issues + PRs with label-based routing, auto PR detection, PR link comments |

Full setup guides: **[Linear](https://itervox.dev/guides/linear-setup/)** · **[GitHub Issues](https://itervox.dev/guides/github-issues/)**.

## SSH remote workers & Fleet Logs

Set `agent.ssh_hosts` in `WORKFLOW.md` and every agent turn runs on a remote machine over SSH. Round-robin dispatch with automatic failover to the next host on connection failure. Combine with NFS, `rsync` hooks, or per-host `git clone` to provision workspaces. Works with Docker-on-remote via `docker exec` inside a `before_run` hook.

Fleet Logs capture the full subagent tree — parent plus every spawned sub-agent, every tool call — via `CLAUDE_CODE_LOG_DIR`. Works identically whether the agent ran locally or across the SSH fleet.

```yaml
# WORKFLOW.md (SSH section)
agent:
  ssh_hosts:
    - build-worker-1.internal
    - build-worker-2.internal:2222
  dispatch_strategy: round-robin  # or: least-loaded
```

Full reference: **[itervox.dev/configuration/](https://itervox.dev/configuration/)** (`ssh_hosts`, `dispatch_strategy`) and per-profile examples in **[itervox.dev/guides/agent-profiles/](https://itervox.dev/guides/agent-profiles/)**.

---

## Lifecycle hooks

Shell scripts run at lifecycle events inside each workspace, via `bash -lc`.

| Hook | Runs | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| `after_create` | Once, right after the workspace directory is created | Fatal — aborts the run attempt |
| `before_run` | Before every agent turn | Fatal — aborts the run attempt |
| `after_run` | After every agent turn | Logged and ignored |
| `before_remove` | Before the workspace is removed (auto-clear) | Logged and ignored |

```yaml
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone git@github.com:org/repo.git .
  before_run: |
    git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main
```

---

## WORKFLOW.md at a glance

One file per project. YAML front matter plus a Liquid prompt template.

```markdown
---
tracker:
  kind: linear                     # or: github
  api_key: $LINEAR_API_KEY
  project_slug: your-project-slug
  active_states: ["Todo", "In Progress"]
  completion_state: "In Review"

agent:
  command: claude --model claude-opus-4-6
  max_concurrent_agents: 5
  max_turns: 20
  profiles:
    code-reviewer:
      command: claude --model claude-opus-4-6
      prompt: "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on correctness and test coverage."

workspace:
  root: ~/.itervox/workspaces
  auto_clear: true

server:
  port: 8090
---

You are working on {{ issue.identifier }} — {{ issue.title }}.

{{ issue.description }}

Implement the change, run tests, and open a PR.
```

The prompt template has access to `issue.*` fields (`identifier`, `title`, `description`, `state`, `priority`, `labels`, `blocked_by`, …) and the `attempt` counter on retries.

## Architecture

Itervox is a single static Go binary that runs a continuous orchestration loop.

```
  WORKFLOW.md ──▶ Orchestrator (single-goroutine state machine)
                    │
                    ├─ every poll_interval_ms:
                    │    reconcile running sessions · fetch candidate issues
                    │    render Liquid prompt · spawn claude / codex subprocess
                    │
                    └─ per-issue worker goroutines stream stream-json events
                       back into the event loop. No locks on the hot path.
```

**Key design decisions:**

- **Single-goroutine state machine.** All orchestrator state mutations happen in one goroutine. Workers communicate back via a buffered event channel — no locks on the hot path.
- **New subprocess per turn.** Claude Code uses `--resume <session-id>` for continuity instead of a persistent app-server process. Conversation history lives server-side.
- **Isolated workspaces.** Each issue gets its own directory under `workspace.root`. Path containment is enforced via `filepath.EvalSymlinks` before every launch — symlink escapes are rejected at runtime.
- **Live config reload.** `WORKFLOW.md` is watched with a 1-second content-hash poller. Config changes hot-reload without restarting in-flight sessions.
- **Embedded dashboard.** The Vite/React bundle is embedded into the Go binary. No sidecar process, no Docker.

### Security posture

Itervox is designed for **high-trust local environments**:

- Claude runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Only run against code you trust.
- API tokens are never logged. Use `$ENV_VAR` references in config; values are resolved at runtime.
- The HTTP server binds `127.0.0.1` by default. Optional shared-token API auth for remote access.
- Hook scripts run with full shell access in the workspace directory. Treat them as trusted code.
- SSH workers use standard host key verification via `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

### Platform support

| Surface | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator + web dashboard | Supported | Supported | Unsupported (use WSL2) |
| TUI | Supported | Supported | Unsupported (use WSL2) |
| Local agent execution | Supported | Supported | Unsupported (use WSL2) |
| SSH worker hosts | Supported | Supported | Unsupported (use WSL2) |

Windows is **unsupported**: Itervox relies on a POSIX shell for hooks and uses worktree paths that do not translate cleanly to Windows. Use WSL2, or run Itervox against Linux/macOS workers.
